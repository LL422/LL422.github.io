Uika: Yeah, my schedule’s been pretty packed recently.

Uika: That’s true… Though you’re not exactly the type to reach out first.
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -right -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_serious01 -expression=sakiko_smile01;
Sakiko: Fair enough. But this time, I have something I’d like your help with.
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_serious01 -expression=sakiko_serious01;
Sakiko: I’m putting together a new band. I want you to join as vocalist and guitarist.
changeFigure:uika/casual/model.json -id=uika -motion=uika_surprised01 -expression=uika_surprised01;
Uika: Eh? Didn’t you already have a band called CRYCHIC?
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_serious02 -expression=sakiko_serious02;
Sakiko: That’s in the past.
Sakiko: This is something different.
Sakiko: We’ll wear masks, keep our identities hidden.
Sakiko: It won’t interfere with your work in Sumimi.
changeFigure:uika/casual/model.json -id=uika -motion=uika_serious01 -expression=uika_serious01;
Uika: I'm a little curious… Why are you starting a new band now?
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_sigh01 -expression=sakiko_sigh01;
Sakiko: I want to build a band that doesn’t rely on emotional ties.
Sakiko: The members don’t need to be friends—just focused, skilled, and disciplined.
Sakiko:I came to you because you’re someone I can count on. -fontSize=default -left;

Uika:...You’re being really serious. That’s not quite the Saki I remember. -fontSize=default -left;
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_sigh02 -expression=sakiko_serious01;
Sakiko: We were close when we were kids, sure.
Sakiko: But I’m not looking for childhood friends this time.
Sakiko: I’m looking for someone who’ll take the stage seriously.
changeFigure:uika/casual/model.json -id=uika -motion=uika_serious01 -expression=uika_serious01;
Uika:...If it’s just about performing, I can do that. -fontSize=default -left;
Uika: I won’t get in your way—and Sumimi won’t be affected.
changeFigure:sakiko/casual/model.json -id=sakiko -motion=sakiko_serious01 -expression=sakiko_smile06;
Sakiko: Good. You’re the vocalist I chose for your ability—
Sakiko: Not just because of our past.
changeFigure:uika/casual/model.json -id=uika -motion=uika_smile01 -expression=uika_smile01;
Uika: That really does sound like you, Saki-chan.
Uika: Well then… let’s make it work.
